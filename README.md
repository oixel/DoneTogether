**To get started:**
1) Clone repo
2) run "npm install" while in done-together folder
3) In your terminal, when CDed into repo, use "git checkout -b YOURNAME_Development" to create your own branch outside of main.
    - This will help avoid merge conflicts
    - All pushed changes will have to be verified by another user before they can get fully committed.

NOTE: To run live site run "npm run dev" in terminal (while in done-together)
